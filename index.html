  <h2>Tiger</h2>
    <img src="tiger.jpg" alt="Tiger power">
    <p>The tiger is the largest cat species, most recognisable for their pattern
      of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.
      The species is classified in the genus Panthera with
      the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators,
      primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are
      territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring
      large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements.
      This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more
      densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with
      humans.</p>

      <h2>Polar Bears</h2>
      <img src="polar bear.jpg" alt="Polar power">
      <p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a carnivorous bear whose native
        range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic
        Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large
        bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear
        (Ursus arctos middendorffi).[3] A boar (adult male) weighs around
        350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb),[4] while a sow (adult female) is about half
        that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear,[5] it
        has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body
        characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow,
        ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its
        diet.</p>

        <h2>Lions</h2>
        <img src="lion.jpg" alt="Lion power">
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the big cats in the genus Panthera
          and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African
          lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some
          males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight,[4] it is the second-largest
          living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan
          Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in
          Gir Forest National Park)</p>
